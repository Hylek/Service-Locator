# Service Locator

The Service Locator is a simple package that implements the service locator pattern in Unity, a simple and straightforward way to place all service classes under one roof for easy accessibility!

This is commonly used in many of my personal projects, as such I have created a package for it so it can be updated in one location rather than per project.
